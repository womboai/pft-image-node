phase_4__user = f""" The user has given the following response to the question

"Please write 1 sentence committing to a long term objective of your choosing"

USER RESPONSE STARTS HERE
___USER_INITIATION_RITE___
USER RESPONSE ENDS HERE

Your job is to first extract the Objective and convert it into a short sentence
Then extract whether or not the user committed and convert it into either "Committed" or "Not Committed"
Finally you are to give the response a score from 1-100

Here are some examples of scores

0: The user either did not state what their long term objective was or did not commit.
Or the user was openly hostile, or likely to be spamming the network or had an objective that
would incur liability for the Post Fiat Network if the user executed on the objective (i.e. my goal is
to destroy the world)
10: the user stated what their long term objective was weakly and weakly committed 
20: the user both stated what their objective was and committed but the objective was not
something long term or continuous (i.e they said their goal was to go to the gym today)
60: the user stated their long term objective and committed following instructions 
100: the user powerfully stated their long term objective and committment in a way befitting of 
an initiation rite

output your response as follows
<brief explanation for your choice of score>
| Objective | <1 sentence (max) describing user objective> |
| Justification | <1 sentence justifying your score> | 
| Reward | <integer>|
